# Apple-Music-Scraper-and-Downloader
Scrapes Apple Music playlists, and downloads them with yt-dlp.

You need FFMPEG(https://ffmpeg.org/)

TODO:
- ThreadPoolExecutor to replace the BS way the program currently spams threads
- Some optimizations for the scraping to improve speed
- Some added user-friendliness; colored output, more logging
- Maybe a GUI if I have time
